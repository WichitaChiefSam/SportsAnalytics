# SportsAnalytics

Welcome to my GitHub Sports Analytics repository. My name is Sam Hays. Since I was 6, I have been a diehard sports fan. Football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer, tennis, MMA, boxing, E-Sports, you name it.

However, my introduction to the data science and coding is a new venture that I am hoping to get a hang for. You are seeing the beginning of my adventures (or misadventures) of this side of things. Enjoy!
